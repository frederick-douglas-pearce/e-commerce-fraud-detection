Logistic Regression
-------------------
Training PR-AUC:     0.6484
Validation PR-AUC:   0.6472
Train-Val Gap:       0.0011 (0.2%)
Diagnosis:           ✓ Good fit

Recommendations:
  • Good bias-variance tradeoff

Random Forest
-------------
Training PR-AUC:     0.9766
Validation PR-AUC:   0.8548
Train-Val Gap:       0.1218 (12.5%)
Diagnosis:           ⚠️  HIGH VARIANCE (Moderate Overfitting)

Recommendations:
  • Model is overfitting
  • Consider: stronger regularization, early stopping, more data

XGBoost
-------
Training PR-AUC:     0.8797
Validation PR-AUC:   0.8675
Train-Val Gap:       0.0122 (1.4%)
Diagnosis:           ✓ Good fit

Recommendations:
  • Good bias-variance tradeoff

XGBoost Iteration Analysis:
  • Single-split validation peaks at iteration 143
  • However, GridSearchCV's 4-fold average is more reliable
  • Recommendation: Trust GridSearchCV's n_estimators from tuning
  • Single-split peaks can vary due to random data split
